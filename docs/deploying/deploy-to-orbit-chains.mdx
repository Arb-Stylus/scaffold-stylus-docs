# Deploy to Orbit Chains

Orbit chains are custom Layer 2 solutions built on Arbitrum's technology stack. Deploying to Orbit chains requires special configuration and considerations compared to standard Arbitrum networks.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Orbit chains, ensure you have:

1. **Stylus CLI tools installed** (version ^0.6.1)
2. **Proper environment configuration** for your target Orbit chain
3. **Contract initialization setup** (Orbit chains require `initialize()` function instead of constructors)

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file in `packages/stylus/` with the appropriate environment variables for your target Orbit chain. Check `packages/stylus/.env.example` for the complete template.

#### Example Environment Configuration

```env
DEPLOYMENT_DIR=

...

# Orbit Chains - Educhain
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_EDUCHAIN_TESTNET=your_account_address_here
RPC_URL_EDUCHAIN_TESTNET=https://testnet.educhain.org/rpc
PRIVATE_KEY_EDUCHAIN_TESTNET=your_private_key_here

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_EDUCHAIN=your_account_address_here
RPC_URL_EDUCHAIN=https://educhain.org/rpc
PRIVATE_KEY_EDUCHAIN=your_private_key_here

...
```

### 2. Required Environment Variables

For each Orbit chain, you need to set:

- `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_<NETWORK>`: Your wallet address
- `RPC_URL_<NETWORK>`: The RPC endpoint for the Orbit chain
- `PRIVATE_KEY_<NETWORK>`: Your wallet's private key

:::warning Security Note
**Never commit your private keys to version control.** Use environment variables and keep your `.env` file in `.gitignore`.
:::

## Contract Requirements for Orbit Chains

### Initialize Function Instead of Constructor

Orbit chains don't support constructors in the same way as standard networks. Instead, you must use an `initialize()` function:

```rust
// In your Rust contract (lib.rs)
use stylus_sdk::prelude::*;

sol_storage! {
    pub struct YourContract {
        uint256 number;
        address owner;
    }
}

#[external]
impl YourContract {
    // Initialize function (replaces constructor)
    pub fn initialize(&mut self) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        // Set initial values here
        self.number.set(0);
        self.owner.set(msg::sender());
        Ok(())
    }

    // Your other functions...
    pub fn get_number(&self) -> Result<u256, Vec<u8>> {
        Ok(self.number.get())
    }
}
```

:::info Important

- The `initialize()` function should only be called once
- Add proper checks to ensure functions don't run if the contract isn't initialized
- Leave the `initialize()` function blank if you don't have any constructor logic
:::

## Deployment Configuration

### 1. Update Deploy Script

Ensure your `packages/stylus/scripts/deploy.ts` has the `isOrbit` flag set to `true` for Orbit chain deployments:

```typescript
// In your deploy.ts script
await deployStylusContract({
    contract: "your-contract",
    constructorArgs: [],
    isOrbit: true,
    ...deployOptions,
  });
```

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration

Update `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` to include your Orbit chain:

```typescript
import * as chains from "./utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains";

export const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [
    chains.arbitrumSepolia,
    chains.educhainTestnet, // Add your Orbit chain
    // ... other networks
  ],
  // ... other config
};
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Check Your Contract

Before deploying, verify your contract compiles correctly:

```bash
cargo stylus check
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.88s
Reading WASM file at target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your-program.wasm
Compressed WASM size: 8.9 KB
Program succeeded Stylus onchain activation checks with Stylus version: 1
```

### 2. Deploy to Orbit Chain

Deploy your contract to the Orbit chain:

```bash
yarn deploy --network <orbit-chain-name>
```

For example:

```bash
# Deploy to Educhain Testnet
yarn deploy --network educhain-testnet

# Deploy to Superposition
yarn deploy --network superposition
```

### 3. Initialize Your Contract

After deployment, you need to call the `initialize()` function:

```bash
# This will be handled automatically by the deploy script if configured properly
# Or you can call it manually through the frontend Debug Contracts page
```

## Available Orbit Chains

Check which Orbit chains are supported:

```bash
yarn info:networks
```

This command will show you all available networks including Orbit chains and their RPC endpoints.
