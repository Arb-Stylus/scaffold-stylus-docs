description: How to set up your development environment for Scaffold Stylus.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

# Environment

Now that your installation is complete, let's configure the development environment for Scaffold Stylus.

## 1. Initialize a Local Blockchain

In the first terminal, start a local Stylus-compatible network:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Arbitrum network using the Nitro dev node. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the Nitro dev node configuration in `packages/stylus/nitro-devnode`.

## 2. Deploy Your Smart Contract

In the second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract can be modified to suit your needs and can be found in `packages/stylus/your-contract/src`. The deployment script is located in `packages/stylus/scripts/deploy.ts`.

## 3. Launch Your NextJS Application

In the third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app at: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the Debug Contracts page or the example UI in the frontend.

## What's Next

- Edit your smart contract in `packages/stylus/your-contract/src`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/stylus/scripts/deploy.ts`
- Create your own contract using the generator: see [Create Your Own Contract](/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts#create-your-own-contract)
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), check out the Next.js documentation.
- Edit the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`
- Edit your smart contract test and run tests with `yarn stylus:test`. Check [test documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/testing-contracts) for more guidances.
