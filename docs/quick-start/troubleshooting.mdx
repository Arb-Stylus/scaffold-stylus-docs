# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter when working with Scaffold-Stylus.

## 1. `stylus` Not Recognized

If you encounter an error stating that `stylus` is not recognized as an external or internal command, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev
```

After that, check if `stylus` is installed by running:

```bash
cargo stylus --version
```

If the version is displayed, `stylus` has been successfully installed and the path is correctly set.

## 2. ABI Not Generated

If you face issues with the ABI not being generated, you can try one of the following solutions:

- **Restart Docker Node**: Pause and restart the Docker node and the local setup of the project. You can do this by deleting all ongoing running containers and then restarting the local terminal using:
  ```bash
  yarn run dev
  ```
- **Modify the Script**: In the `run-dev-node.sh` script, replace the line:

  ```bash
  cargo stylus export-abi
  ```

  with:

  ```bash
  cargo run --manifest-path=Cargo.toml --features export-abi
  ```

- **Access Denied Issue**: If you encounter an access denied permission error during ABI generation, run the following command and then execute the script again:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER target
  ```

## 3. Fixing Line Endings and Running Shell Scripts in WSL

> ⚠️ This guide provides step-by-step instructions to resolve the Command not found error caused by CRLF line endings in shell scripts when running in a WSL environment.

Shell scripts created in Windows often have `CRLF` line endings, which cause issues in Unix-like environments such as WSL. To fix this:

**Using `dos2unix`:**

1. Install `dos2unix` (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install dos2unix
   ```

2. Convert the script's line endings:

   ```bash
   dos2unix run-dev-node.sh
   ```

3. Make the Script Executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run-dev-node.sh
   ```

4. Run the Script in WSL:
   ```bash
   bash run-dev-node.sh
   ```

## 4. Network Connection Issues

### RPC Endpoint Problems

If you're having trouble connecting to networks:

1. **Check your RPC URL**: Ensure your `RPC_URL_<network>` environment variable is correct
2. **Test network availability**: Run `yarn test:networks` to verify available networks
3. **Use fallback RPCs**: If your primary RPC is down, the system will automatically use public RPC endpoints

### Private Key Issues

If deployment fails due to private key problems:

1. **Verify private key format**: Ensure your private key doesn't include the `0x` prefix
2. **Check account balance**: Make sure your account has sufficient funds for deployment
3. **Network mismatch**: Ensure you're using the correct private key for the target network

## 5. Contract Deployment Failures

### Compilation Errors

If your Rust contract fails to compile:

1. **Check Rust toolchain**: Ensure you're using the correct Rust version

   ```bash
   rustup default 1.87
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.87
   ```

2. **Verify dependencies**: Check that all dependencies in `Cargo.toml` are compatible
3. **Clean build**: Try cleaning and rebuilding
   ```bash
   cargo clean
   cargo stylus check
   ```

## 6. Frontend Issues

### Contract Not Found

If your frontend can't find deployed contracts:

1. **Check network configuration**: Ensure `scaffold.config.ts` has the correct `targetNetworks`
2. **Verify deployment**: Check that contracts were deployed to the correct network
3. **Refresh ABI**: Run `yarn export-abi` to regenerate contract interfaces

### Wallet Connection Problems

If wallet connection fails:

1. **Check network**: Ensure your wallet is connected to the correct network
2. **Clear cache**: Clear your browser cache and wallet cache
3. **Check wallet permissions**: Ensure your wallet has the necessary permissions
