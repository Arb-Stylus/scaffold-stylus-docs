# Pull Requests

Pull requests are how you propose changes to the Scaffold-Stylus documentation. They allow for discussion, review, and collaboration before changes are merged into the main branch.

## Pull Request Process

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr):

git remote add upstream https://github.com/Arb-Stylus/scaffold-stylus-docs.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch with a descriptive name
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-installation-guide
# or

```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `feature/` - New features
