## Finding Issues to Work On

### Browse Existing Issues

1. **Visit our [Issues page](https://github.com/Arb-Stylus/scaffold-stylus-docs/issues)**
2. **Use labels to filter:**
   - `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
   - `help wanted` - Community help needed
   - `bug` - Bug reports
   - `enhancement` - Feature requests
   - `documentation` - Documentation improvements

3. **Check issue status:**
   - **Open** - Available to work on
   - **Assigned** - Someone is already working on it
   - **In Progress** - Work has started

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are perfect for new contributors:

- Small, well-defined tasks
- Clear requirements
- Good for learning the codebase
- Usually documentation or minor fixes

### Claiming an Issue

1. **Comment on the issue** expressing your interest
2. **Wait for maintainer approval** before starting work
3. **Assign yourself** if you have permission, or ask a maintainer to assign you
4. **Create a branch** and start working

## Creating High-Quality Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search thoroughly** - Check if a similar issue already exists
2. **Use the search bar** with relevant keywords
3. **Check closed issues** - Your issue might have been resolved

### Writing Effective Issues

**Title Guidelines:**
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use action verbs when appropriate
- Keep it concise but informative

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå "Problem with docs"
- ‚úÖ "Fix broken link in installation guide"
- ‚ùå "Add something"
- ‚úÖ "Add troubleshooting section for Windows users"

**Description Guidelines:**
- **Provide context** - Explain the background
- **Be specific** - Include exact steps, URLs, or code snippets
- **Include examples** - Show what you mean
- **Add screenshots** - Visual context is invaluable
- **Mention your environment** - OS, browser, Node.js version

### Issue Labels

We use labels to categorize issues:

**Type Labels:**
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `question` - Further information is requested

**Priority Labels:**
- `priority: high` - Critical issues
- `priority: medium` - Important issues
- `priority: low` - Nice to have

**Status Labels:**
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `duplicate` - Issue already exists
- `wontfix` - Will not be addressed

## Issue Lifecycle

1. **Created** - Issue is opened
2. **Triage** - Maintainers review and label
3. **Assigned** - Someone takes ownership
4. **In Progress** - Work has started
5. **Review** - Solution is being reviewed
6. **Closed** - Issue is resolved

## Best Practices

### For Issue Creators

- **Be patient** - Maintainers are volunteers
- **Provide updates** - Respond to questions promptly
- **Be respectful** - Follow our code of conduct
- **Close issues** - Mark as resolved when fixed

### For Issue Contributors

- **Ask questions** - Clarify requirements before starting
- **Provide updates** - Keep the issue updated with progress
- **Link PRs** - Reference the issue in your pull request
- **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your solution works

## Getting Help
