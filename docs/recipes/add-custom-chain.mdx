# Add a custom chain

This recipe demonstrates how to add a custom chain to your project. We'll use an Arbitrum Orbit chain as an example, but you can apply this process to any other chain you want to add.
Scaffold-Stylus uses [viem/chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) as a list of chains and provides a set of supported chains in `packages/nextjs/utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains.ts`.

Arbitrum Orbit chains are custom blockchains built using Arbitrum's technology stack that settle on Arbitrum L2s or Ethereum. Since these are custom chains, you'll need to add them manually to your project.

:::info
Scaffold-Stylus consists of two parts:

- `packages/nextjs`: nextjs frontend
- `packages/stylus`: use Arbitrum Stylus to deploy smart contracts

The frontend and the Stylus project use a different set of chains.
You should add the chain to both the frontend and your stylus config. Checkout [deploying your smart contract](/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts) section on how to deploy different chains.

By doing this, you will be able to deploy the contracts to the chain you added and interact with them from the frontend.

:::

### Step 1: Define the chain

First, add your custom chain to `packages/nextjs/utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains.ts`.

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains.ts"
import { defineChain } from "viem";

// Arbitrum Orbit chain example
export const myOrbitChain = defineChain({
  id: 123456789, // Replace with your Orbit chain's chain ID
  name: "My Orbit Chain",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "Ethereum", symbol: "ETH", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ["https://your-orbit-chain-rpc-url.com"], // Replace with your Orbit chain's RPC URL
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: "My Orbit Explorer",
      url: "https://your-orbit-explorer.com", // Replace with your Orbit chain's block explorer
    },
  },
  // Optional: Add testnet version
  testnet: true, // Set to false for mainnet
});
```

In this file, we're defining an Arbitrum Orbit chain. We're using the `defineChain` function from viem to define the chain. You can add as many chains as you want to the `supportedChains.ts` file.

:::tip
When setting up your Orbit chain, you'll need to:

1. Get the chain ID from your Orbit chain deployment
2. Obtain the RPC URL from your Orbit chain provider
3. Set up a block explorer (optional but recommended)
4. Configure the native currency (usually ETH for Orbit chains)
:::

### Step 2: Update `scaffold.config.ts`

Next, update your `scaffold.config.ts` file to include the new chain:

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts"
import * as chains from "./utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains";
// ... other imports and type definitions

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [chains.myOrbitChain],
  // ... other configuration options
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;

export default scaffoldConfig;
```

If you'd like to add multiple chains, you can do so by adding them to the `targetNetworks` array. Below is a simple example of how to add multiple chains.

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts"
import * as chains from "./utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains";

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [chains.myOrbitChain, chains.myOrbitChainTestnet],
  // ... other configuration options
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;
```

### Step 3: Arbitrum Orbit Specific Considerations

When working with Arbitrum Orbit chains, there are a few additional considerations:

#### Gas Configuration

Orbit chains may have different gas configurations. You might need to adjust gas settings in your contracts:

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains.ts"
export const myOrbitChain = defineChain({
  // ... other chain configuration
  fees: {
    baseFeeMultiplier: 1.2, // Adjust based on your Orbit chain's gas model
  },
});
```

#### Bridge Configuration

If your Orbit chain supports bridging, you may want to configure bridge contracts:

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains.ts"
export const myOrbitChain = defineChain({
  // ... other chain configuration
  contracts: {
    multicall3: {
      address: "0xca11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976ca11", // Standard multicall3 address
    },
    // Add bridge contracts if needed
  },
});
```

#### Stylus Compatibility

Since Scaffold-Stylus supports Arbitrum Stylus, your Orbit chain should be compatible with Stylus contracts. Make sure your Orbit chain deployment includes Stylus support.
